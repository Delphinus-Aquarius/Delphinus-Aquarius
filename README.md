Hello there!  I'm Delphi and I am new to the development world!  I am currently in school for full stack web development.

The languages I am learning are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, VUE.js, Python, Django, and SQL

I'm looking to collab and learn on different full stack development projects. 

If you need to reach me, please do so on here, if necessary I will provide my contact info at a later time!

Thanks for reading!
